The regurgitator
================

Set up a proxy recorder in order to later spool off data. Useful for
integration tests, and looking into your communication.

This application has been made in order to be able to create a static
data source for setting up tests with gemini:
https://github.com/bem/gemini

The source code is based on

* http://www.dropwizard.io/
* https://github.com/adamfisk/LittleProxy

Running the proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need Java-8 and Maven 3.x. Check out, compile with maven and run::

   mvn clean install
   rm -f rm *-service/target/original*
   java -jar *-service/target/*-service-*-SNAPSHOT.jar server *-app/src/main/resources/etc/*.yml

The strange path to the dropwizard.yml file is due to amedia deployment defaults.
The configuration is a standard dropwizard configuration.

Configuration which is specific for the regurgitator is:

============== =======================================================================
storageManager  Class name of something which implements ServerResponseStore
                Defaults to feeble in-memory storage.
recordOnStart   If is true, Regurgitator will start in a recording mode, saving and
                caching content from each request. Otherwise, will start in listening
                mode, serving the saved content for each request if previously cached.
proxyPort       Which port the proxy listens
============== =======================================================================

Notice that you at the time of writing has a storage choice of file storage and
in-memory storage.

Testing the proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the index page from somewhere using the proxy::

    GET -p http://localhost:9077 http://www.rb.no/
    http --proxy=http:http://localhost:9077 http://www.rb.no/

You should be able to open http://localhost:9076/
and find the request there.

The tools:

* http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/
* http://httpie.org/

You can also change your proxy setting in your favorite browser to
use the regurgitator as proxy.

Using java-setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to add the following to your java command::

    -Dhttp.proxyHost=localhost  -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts= -Dhttp.proxyPort=9077

This can also be added to your MAVEN_OPTS, if you are running maven::

   export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttp.proxyPort=9077 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts= $MAVEN_OPTS"

Future directions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support "cache mode". Fetch it only if it is not already present
* In "cache mode", support expiration by size and / or time 
* Paging in the key list
* Invalidation of content
* Searching for key / content
